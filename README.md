## Methods

It provides two methods, which can be used independent:

### The `colorcolumn` method

With this method `colorcolumn` gets set to a list containing every column for
the inactive windows, effectively resulting in a different background color
(see `hl-CursorColumn`).

This is enabled by default and can be disabled, e.g. if you want to use the
syntax method only:

    let g:diminactive_use_colorcolumn = 0

### The `syntax` method

There is an option to disable syntax highlighting for inactive windows. It is
disabled by default, and you can enable it using:

    let g:diminactive_use_syntax = 1

## Commands

The following commands are provided to control it:

### Global control
 - DimInactive / DimInactiveOn
 - DimInactiveOff
 - DimInactiveToggle

 - DimInactiveSyntaxOn
 - DimInactiveSyntaxOff

 - DimInactiveColorcolumnOn
 - DimInactiveColorcolumnOff

### Control on the buffer level
 - DimInactiveBufferOff
 - DimInactiveBufferOn

### Control on the window level
 - DimInactiveWindowOff
 - DimInactiveWindowOn

## Credits

It is based on an [idea from Paul Isambert][1], which got turned into a
[StackOverflow answer][2] and then into a plugin, incorporating the
suggestions made by joeytwiddle.

## Caveats
* It might slow down redrawing of windows.
* It will only work with lines containing text (i.e. not `~` (non-lines)).

## Related plugins

* The [cursorcross.vim](https://github.com/mtth/cursorcross.vim) plugin
  provides automatic and "refreshingly sane `cursorcolumn` and `cursorline`
  handling".
* The [ZoomWin](http://drchip.org/astronaut/vim/index.html#ZOOMWIN) plugin
  allows to (un-)maximize the current window.
* [goyo.vim](https://github.com/junegunn/goyo.vim) provides distraction-free
  writing in Vim.
